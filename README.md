### üîê Authentication System 

This project includes a full authentication system using the following stack:

* React for UI

* Axios for HTTP requests

* TanStack Query (@tanstack/react-query) for API state management

* React Router for navigation and route protection
* React Hook Form


### üîê Authentication Module

This app uses a modular structure to implement login and token handling.

#### üìÅ File Overview

* **`api/auth.js`**
  Handles API requests for authentication:

  * `login()` ‚Äî Authenticates user via `POST /AdminAccount/Login`
  * `refreshToken()` ‚Äî Renews token via `POST /Account/RefreshToken`

* **`auth/AuthProvider.jsx`**
  Provides global authentication state using React Context:

  * Stores tokens and user info in `localStorage`
  * Exposes `loginUser()` and `logoutUser()` methods
  * Accessible via `useAuth()` hook

* **`pages/Login.jsx`**
  Renders the login form and manages authentication flow:

  * Uses TanStack Query‚Äôs `useMutation` to call the login API
  * Saves tokens on success and redirects to the dashboard

> This structure ensures a clean separation between API logic, global state, and UI, making the auth system easy to maintain and scale.

### üìä Dashboard Module

Displays a paginated list of materials with infinite scroll behavior, only accessible when the user is authenticated.

#### üìÅ File Overview

* **`api/fetchMaterials.js`**
  Encapsulates logic to fetch materials from the API using base64-encoded filters:

  * `fetchMaterials({ pageParam })` ‚Äî Returns paginated data with `Materials`, `hasMore`, and `nextPage`.

* **`pages/DashboardMaterials.jsx`**
  Renders the list of materials and implements lazy loading using `@tanstack/react-query` and `react-intersection-observer`:

  * Uses `useInfiniteQuery()` to fetch data incrementally.
  * Uses `useInView()` to detect scroll and trigger `fetchNextPage()`.
  * Maps over paginated data to render the full list of materials.
  * Automatically loads more content as user scrolls.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Features

* If the user is **logged in**, the Dashboard is shown.
* The Dashboard fetches a **list of materials** with support for:

  * Pagination (20 items per page)
  * Lazy loading (via intersection observer)
* Smooth **infinite scroll** experience without manual page navigation.

> This setup decouples fetching logic from the UI and leverages modern React tooling (TanStack Query) for a clean, scalable data flow.

### üñ•Ô∏è UI & Dashboard Design

The dashboard features a clean and modern interface with a white background and subtle purple accents. It includes responsive, card-based layouts and data tables for key insights such as top products and top customers. The design emphasizes clarity and usability, with intuitive navigation, consistent typography, and hover effects for interactivity. Components are built using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, ensuring a polished and accessible user experience across devices.For charts used ApexCharts .
